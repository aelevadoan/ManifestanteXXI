Step 1: What you need...
------------------------

You will need the following items:

16X DVD Burner. I used an LG burner I had as a spare.or...You can buy the [Red LASER DIODEHERE](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=3&campid=5336228863&toolid=10001&customid=&ext=200mw+laser+diode+650nm+Kip+Kay+project+suitable&satitle=200mw+laser+diode+650nm+Kip+Kay+project+suitable)

Step 2: And...

A Mini-Mag Flashlight [You can get oneHERE](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=3&campid=5336237408&toolid=10001&customid=&ext=Maglite+Mini+Mag-Lite+2+Cell+AA+flashlight+NEW&satitle=Maglite+Mini+Mag-Lite+2+Cell+AA+flashlight+NEW)

An AixiZ Laser Module. [You can get oneHERE](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=3&campid=5336228859&toolid=10001&customid=&ext=650nm+5mW+laser+module.3.2V+to+with+lens+650+nm+OEM&satitle=650nm+5mW+laser+module.3.2V+to+with+lens+650+nm+OEM)

Small jewelers screwdrivers, X-Acto knife, metal snips, drill, roundfile and other small tools.

Step 3: Extract the DVD Laser Diode
-----------------------------------

After removing all of the screws from the DVD burner, remove the cover and the DVD drawer. This will expose the laser carriage assembly.

Step 4: Extract the Laser Diode...
----------------------------------

While all DVD burners are a bit different, they all rely on 2 rails that the laser assembly moves on. Remove all screws and do whatever it takes to free up the rails so the laser assembly slides off. Disconnect or cut and cabling and flat connectors.

Step 5: Continue extraction...
------------------------------

Once you have the assembly off of the burner it's time to start disassembling it by removing all the screws you see. There will be many small screws so be patient. Cut any flat cabling off. There could be two diodes, one for the CD portion of the burner (IR diode) and the actual DVD burning diode (red). That is the one you want. There will be a 3-pin circuit board on the red diode that you want to CAREFULLY remove with a soldering iron revealing 3 pins. You can test the diode with 2-AA batteries and referring to the polarity chart (on the video). You will have to remove the diode from the housing and that will be in acase-by-case basis depending on the burner. The laser diode is fragileso take care in the final extraction process.

Step 6: The new DVD Laser Diode!

Here is what your extracting diode will look like! You can get the burning [LASER DIODEHERE](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=3&campid=5336228863&toolid=10001&customid=&ext=200mw+laser+diode+650nm+Kip+Kay+project+suitable&satitle=200mw+laser+diode+650nm+Kip+Kay+project+suitable)

Step 7: Preparing the AixiZ housing...

Remove the label from the AixiZ housing and unscrew the housing leavinga top and bottom portion of the housing. Inside the top housing is theoriginal (5mw) laser diode that has to be removed. I used the bottom ofan X-Acto knife and with a couple of sharp taps, the original diode willcome out. It will likely be destroyed doing this but I have beensuccessful in removing them before but using a very small screwdriverand tapping around the diode until it is freed up.

Step 8: Assembling the housing...
---------------------------------

I used a little bit of Arctic Silver Thermal grease and slowly installedthe new DVD diode in the AixiZ housing. Using a pair of pliers, I SLOWLYsqueezed the edges of the diode down into the housing until it wasflush. CAREFUL!

Step 9: Installing it in your MiniMag!
--------------------------------------

After soldering two leads to the positive and negative diode connectors,it's time to install it in the MiniMag. After disassembling the MiniMag(remove the top, the reflector, lens and bulb) you will need to enlargethe MiniMag reflector using a reaming tool, round metal file or drill ora combination of all three.

Step 10: Final Step!!
---------------------

Be sure to remove the batteries from the MiniMag and after checkingpolarity, slip your new DVD Laser housing down into the top of theMiniMag where the bulb would go. Screw the top of the MiniMag on andslip the reflector over the Laser housing. You will not be using theplastic MiniMag lens.**UPDATE: If you intend to use this as more than just a novelty item, adriver circuit is recommended. Here is a basic driver circuit that canbe built for this project which will regulate the voltage going to thediode.

Step 11: Test it out!!

Reinstall the 2-AA batteries and slowly unscrew the top of the MiniMag,turning on your new Laser Flashlight! Caution!! Laser diodes aredangerous and should never be pointed at any living thing. Thanks and Ihope you enjoyed this Instructable!

### FAQ

Here are the answers to common questions about this project.

 * Can I use a CD player/burner or DVD player Diode. 
  * No. Only a DVD burner diode 16x or faster will work.
 * Do I need the Aixiz Housing? 
  * Yes. It serves as a heatsink for the high-power diode and also the focusing element is essential.
 * What happens to the existing circuit board that is inside the Aixizhousing? 
  * It is not used for this project. You can keep it for a lower mA diodelike a standard red laser pointer diode or just discard it.
 * What's with the 'pins' you used? 
  * The 'pins' are snippings from old resistors. You can use any sturdywire. They are soldered to the diode and then inserted in the mini-magplastic fitting that original held the mini-mag lightbulb.
 * Can I use a regular laser pointer from the dollar store as thehousing. 
  * See the previous Question/Answer
 * Can I use another type of flashlight? 
  * Not sure. This project is based on the mini-mag.
 * My diode is not burning anything. What did I do wrong? 
  * In order for the diode to 'burn' it needs to be focused to a finepoint and also the object needs to be black or marked black with aSharpie.
 * Why can't I see the beam like I can see in the video? 
  * I used smoke to make the beam visible.
 * Should I use a driver circuit?
  * The basis for this project was to show that you could use a diodefrom a DVD burner and put it in a flashlight and make it 'burn'. Ths isa novelty item and not designed for long-term or regular use. If youwant to do that, a driver circuit is highly recommended.
